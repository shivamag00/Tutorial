## Tutorial App
This documentaion is **only for the app.**

### What do we intend to do?
* This app represents the frontend part for the backend sprintboot java application which we created in the [previous tutorial](https://medium.com/webtutsplus/a-simple-user-authentication-api-made-with-spring-boot-4a7135ff1eca)  
* For readers who are familiar with web development, this app is similar to a HTML form that can POST data to backend, so that this data can be processed by a backend script and the response from the backend is displayed to the user.   
* Using this app, the user can register, login, logout and delete the user table from the backend service we created in previous tutorial.
